This target gathers File System files, Registry Hives, Event Logs, Scheduled Tasks, Evidence of Execution, SRUM data, Web Browser data, LNK Files, Jump Lists, 3rd party remote access software logs, and 3rd party antivirus software logs. *WindowsDefender* was choosen because the *KapeTriage* didn't gather that data aswell.\n",
